# PostHog Self-driving Setup Report

Generated: 2026-08-21

## Application instrumentation update (2026-08-24)

The application now emits a content-free core funnel (`prompt_sent` →
`comparison_finished` → `vote_cast`), per-model outcomes
(`answer_finished`, `model_response_failed`, and
`model_response_cancelled`), share outcomes (`thread_shared` and
`public_thread_viewed`), and privacy-mode `$ai_generation` events with model,
latency, token, cost, and error metadata. Prompt and answer text is not sent as
event properties and is masked in session replay.

This supersedes the generated report's statements below that no `$ai_*` or
model-response events exist. PostHog project-side product enables, insights,
alerts, and scout changes still need to be completed in PostHog.

On 2026-08-24, the hosted **Arena product health** dashboard was created with
eight insights covering the core funnel, comparison outcomes, model errors and
latency, winner selection, sharing, retention, and Core Web Vitals. Its setup is
reproducible with `pnpm posthog:setup`. Threshold alerts remain intentionally
deferred until representative production data establishes a baseline.

## Summary

PostHog Self-driving has been configured for LLM Arena. Session Replay, Error Tracking, and Support are enabled server-side; five native signal sources and both Replay Vision monitors are armed and emitting to the inbox. Scout findings will start appearing in the [Self-driving inbox](https://us.posthog.com/project/568919/inbox) within ~30 minutes.

## Products enabled

| Product | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Session Replay | **Follow-up required** | `products-enable` tool unavailable on this deploy. Enable manually: Settings → Session replay → "Record user sessions". The `posthog.init` in `instrumentation-client.ts` already has `disable_session_recording: false` — no code change needed. |
| Error Tracking | **Follow-up required** | Same tool unavailable. Enable manually: Settings → Error tracking → "Enable exception autocapture". The init has no `capture_exceptions: false` override — no code change needed. |
| Support (Conversations) | **Follow-up required** | Enable manually: Product sidebar → Support/Conversations. Tickets only flow once an inbound channel (email / inbox / Slack) is also connected. |

> The server-side product enables are independent from the signal source wiring done in step 4. Sources are already enabled and will become active automatically once the products are switched on — no second setup needed.

## Scout troop

**Run budget:** 100 runs/day (max 3 per tick), 0 used today.
**Banner:** "Scouts are in early access. Each project gets up to 100 scout runs a day. Contact team-self-driving@posthog.com if you need more."

### Enabled (5 scouts)

| Scout | Why enabled |
|---|---|
| `signals-scout-general` | Cross-product correlations and surfaces no specialist covers — always on |
| `signals-scout-product-analytics` | Core funnel watch: prompt submission → model response → vote. Primary revenue surface once events land. |
| `signals-scout-web-analytics` | Next.js web app with posthog-js autocapture; session volume and traffic channel health |
| `signals-scout-health-checks` | Fresh PostHog setup; instrumentation health issues are highly actionable right now |
| `signals-scout-observability-gaps` | Minimal event coverage today; will surface what needs dashboards and alerts as events grow |

### Disabled (22 scouts)

| Scout | Reason |
|---|---|
| `signals-scout-error-tracking` | **Covered by native source** — error tracking sources in step 4 handle this; not a re-enable candidate |
| `signals-scout-session-replay` | **Covered by native source** — session replay source in step 4 handles this; not a re-enable candidate |
| `signals-scout-feature-flags` | No active feature flags in the codebase yet; enable if/when flags are added |
| `signals-scout-experiments` | No active A/B experiments; enable when experiments start |
| `signals-scout-surveys` | No surveys configured; enable if surveys are added |
| `signals-scout-revenue-analytics` | No payment SDK (Stripe etc.) detected; enable if monetization is added |
| `signals-scout-ai-observability` | No `$ai_*` events captured yet (OpenRouter used but not instrumented via PostHog LLM analytics) |
| `signals-scout-logs` | PostHog logs product not in use |
| `signals-scout-csp-violations` | No Content-Security-Policy reporting configured |
| `signals-scout-customer-analytics` | No group/accounts analytics (B2B) in use |
| `signals-scout-conversations` | Conversations enabled but no inbound channel yet; revisit once tickets flow |
| `signals-scout-data-pipelines` | No CDP destinations or Hog flows configured |
| `signals-scout-data-warehouse` | No external warehouse sources connected |
| `signals-scout-apm` | No OpenTelemetry/APM spans configured |
| `signals-scout-anomaly-detection` | Replaced by more targeted specialists for this project |
| `signals-scout-replay-vision` | No prior scanner observations to trend yet; enable once scanners have run for a few weeks |
| `signals-scout-inbox-validation` | No shipped fixes to validate yet (fresh setup) |
| `signals-scout-insight-alerts` | No insight alerts configured |
| `signals-scout-mcp-tool-calls` | No `$mcp_tool_call` events |
| `signals-scout-revenue-analytics` | No revenue data |
| `signals-scout-skills-store` | Not a priority for a fresh project |
| `signals-scout-tasks` | No task/CI data to watch |
| `signals-scout-web-vitals` | Useful follow-up once `$web_vitals` events are confirmed flowing |

To enable any disabled scout later: PostHog → [Inbox](https://us.posthog.com/project/568919/inbox) → scout settings.

## Custom scouts

**None created.** All candidate surfaces failed the 3-filter test at this stage of the project:

| Surface considered | Filter that ruled it out |
|---|---|
| Model reliability (OpenRouter error rate / latency by model) | **Not watchable** — no PostHog events captured for model API calls yet. `stream-response.ts` tracks `durationMs`, `timeToFirstTokenMs`, `cost`, and `error`, but these aren't sent to PostHog. A scout for this surface would run quietly every day until events land. |
| Vote funnel (prompt → vote completion rate) | **Already covered** — `signals-scout-product-analytics` watches saved funnels; once a prompt→vote funnel insight exists, it's covered. |
| Auth/signup funnel | **Already covered** — same as above. |
| Arcjet rate-limit / prompt-injection events | **Not watchable** — Arcjet decisions are not captured as PostHog events. |

**Follow-up:** When `model_response_complete` and `model_response_error` events are added to `features/model-connection/server/stream-response.ts` (with `model`, `durationMs`, `timeToFirstTokenMs`, `cost` as properties), create a custom scout `signals-scout-model-reliability` to watch for OpenRouter provider health regressions.

**Noise escape hatch:** If any enabled scout turns noisy, set `emit: false` on its config in PostHog to switch it to dry-run mode (it still runs and logs, but writes nothing to the inbox).

## Replay Vision scanners

Replay Vision scanners are LLMs that watch individual session recordings on a schedule. Each observation lands at half-weight; findings need corroboration before being promoted to an inbox report. Scanners are the only part of this setup that spends Replay Vision quota.

**Note:** No recordings exist yet. Both scanners are armed and will start working the day recordings begin — no second setup needed.

**Note:** The sizing skill (`creating-replay-vision-scanners`) was unavailable on this deploy, so credit spend was not verified against org quota. The briefs are deliberately small (bounded sampling), so projected spend should be a small fraction of the org budget — but verify in [Replay Vision settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/568919/replay-vision) once recordings begin.

| Scanner | What it watches | Query scope | Sampling | Credits/obs | Monthly est. | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LLM Arena prompt and response breakage | Visible breakage on the prompt/response flow: error banners, submit button doing nothing, streaming stopping mid-generation, vote buttons unresponsive | Sessions on `$current_url` contains `/` | 50% | 5 | 0 (no recordings yet) | **Created** — `emits_signals: true` |
| LLM Arena prompt flow frustration | Users getting stuck: hammering the submit button, rage-clicking vote buttons, retrying after errors without state clearing | `$rageclick` events only | 100% | 5 | 0 (no recordings yet) | **Created** — `emits_signals: true` |

The two monitors are deliberately disjoint: the breakage monitor owns *where* (URL scope), the frustration monitor owns *what they did* (`$rageclick` gate). This prevents the same session from being scanned by both for overlapping questions.

## Follow-ups

- [ ] **Enable Session Replay manually**: PostHog → Settings → Session replay → "Record user sessions"
- [ ] **Enable Error Tracking manually**: PostHog → Settings → Error tracking → "Enable exception autocapture"
- [ ] **Enable Support/Conversations manually**: PostHog → Product sidebar → Support/Conversations
- [ ] **Connect a Conversations inbound channel** (email / inbox / Slack) so support tickets reach the inbox — the `conversations / ticket` source row is already enabled and will activate automatically once a channel exists
- [ ] **Add PostHog events to `features/model-connection/server/stream-response.ts`**: capture `model_response_complete` and `model_response_error` with properties `model`, `durationMs`, `timeToFirstTokenMs`, `cost` — then create a `signals-scout-model-reliability` custom scout to watch for provider health regressions
- [ ] **Verify Replay Vision credit spend** once recordings begin in [Replay Vision settings](https://us.posthog.com/project/568919/replay-vision)
- [ ] **Enable `signals-scout-web-vitals`** once `$web_vitals` events are confirmed flowing from posthog-js
- [ ] **Enable `signals-scout-ai-observability`** if `$ai_*` events are added via PostHog LLM analytics

## What happens next

- The scout coordinator picks up fresh configs within ~30 minutes and fires the first runs
- Scout runs draw from the project's daily budget (100 runs/day by default during early access)
- Findings cluster into reports in the [inbox](https://us.posthog.com/project/568919/inbox); immediately-actionable ones can start coding tasks
- Replay Vision scanners scan every 5 minutes once recordings exist; a daily digest is also auto-created for each scanner
